Handle iTunes In App Purchase Receipt Verification.

== Please Note

  This gem is clone of original itunes-receipt by nov matake {https://github.com/nov/itunes-receipt}[https://github.com/nov/itunes-receipt]

  There are some changes that were needed for my project. So, I'd recommend using original gem since it might be already updated with fixes that I've added here at this copy.

== Installation

  gem install suhovius-itunes-receipt

== Usage

   require 'itunes/receipt'

   # pass Base64 encoded raw receipt data which you received from your iOS app
   receipt = Itunes::Receipt.verify! 'ewoJInNpZ25hdHVyZSIgPSAi...'
   receipt.product_id     # => 'com.example.products.100gems'
   receipt.transaction_id # => '1234567890'
    :

See lib/itunes/receipt.rb for more attributes.

If you want to accept iTunes sandbox receipts, do like this.
With <code>allow_sandbox_receipt</code> option specified, this gem post given receipt data to iTunes production first, and when iTunes production tells it's sandbox receipt, re-send it to iTunes sandbox again automatically.
Without this option, this gem just raises an exception.

  receipt = Itunes::Receipt.verify! 'ewoJInNpZ25hdHVyZSIgPSAi...', :allow_sandbox_receipt
  receipt.sandbox? # => true/false

If you want to accept ONLY iTunes sandbox receipts (in your stable server etc.), call <code>Itunes.sandbox!</code> somewhere before you call <code>Itunes::Receipt.verify!</code>.
Then all verification call after that goes to iTunes sandbox, until you do <code>Itunes.sandbox = false</code>.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
